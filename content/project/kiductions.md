Kiductions was a video sharing website aimed at 8-18 year olds. The website appeared on [the CBBC show 'Pocket money pitch'](https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/watch/what-next-kiductions). I was hired by the contest winners, Phoebe and Joe, to develop the Kiductions website. Eventually after evaluating the feasability with Phoebe and Joe, they realised that it was not cheap to host a video sharing site, and for that reason, the project was cancelled.
