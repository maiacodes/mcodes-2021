Pulsr was a chatting app designed for small groups that me and a group of friends co-founded in early 2021.

We left it as a proof of concept after further evaluation of competition in the industry. A big thanks to [James](https://jmsheff.me/), [Pranav](https://pranav.page), and [Emil](https://emil.codes) for working on this project with me.
