Eutenly was a Discord bot designed for searching the web that me and my friend [Pranav](https://pranav.page) founded together. We began testing with a select group of people in December 2020, and then Eutenly was released as a private beta in March 2021. In June 2021 we decided to shut down Eutenly due to poor uptake. The source code is now available on [GitHub](https://github.com/eutenly), and parts of Eutenly became Pranav's [Gitbound](https://gitbound.com) which is now available publicly.
