Mobitel was a Minecraft Spigot Plugin I developed for my [T-Island](/project/tisland) project which introduced the idea of mobile phones, cell towers, mobile networks, and the internet to Minecraft. It all started with the custom in-game item 'Mobitel X', which was a smartphone in Minecraft. When the phone was opened, it attempted to connect to a nearby cell tower in Minecraft of the mobile network the user was registered to in-game

Like true mobile networks, we even sometimes created duel-stack (multi network) sites in rural areas, and created disguised cell towers inside trees.

When launched, the phones had many apps, and even an app-store to get new ones!
