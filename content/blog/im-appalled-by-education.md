Throughout my life, I have endured over 10 years of schooling here 
in the UK, and for all those years, it was the bane of my life. 
From starting secondary school, I knew I was queer, but I never 
spoke about it, because of how much homophobia there is just 
casually in British secondary schools, It's genuinely horrific. 
I've heard death threats towards openly gay people at my old 
school from students, with senior leadership choosing not to even 
acknowledge it - and because of this, it took me until the last 
year of school to even come out openly. 

I learn differently, I am a very self-taught person, It's how I 
taught myself how to program from such a young age -
but this self-paced and self-driven method of 
education is completely disregarded in Britain. The Department of 
Education has quite strict regulations on how students should be 
taught, and how schools should operate - but these regulations 
don't actually reflect the 21st century. 

For example, [the vast majority](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jan/18/school-uniform-results) of British secondary schools
require that students wear a school uniform, which if 
you think about for more than 5 minutes, is an incredibly 
ridiculous and antiquated system. In the modern workplace, most 
people aren't required to wear a suite and tie to work, are they? 
Heck, in most of the tech industry you'd be considered trendy for 
coming to work in pyjamas. Whenever students even try to question 
these concepts, they always get brushed away with *"We're preparing 
you for the real workplace"* - well, as we've discussed, you're 
really not. All school uniforms do is encourage conformity, I have 
never seen an argument *for* school uniforms that can be backed up 
reliably by multiple studies. 

The current British Government seems to be obsessed with keeping 
the current status quo, they're even trying to [roll out Latin](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jul/31/latin-introduced-40-state-secondaries-england)
in secondary schools. I have a feeling that the Government thinks 
that implementing these things will make students more 
right-winged, but it couldn't be further from the opposite. The 
amount of nonsense that the Conservative party pulls students 
through is making them fed-up, and wanting change. These days, 
when a student asks why they can't have dyed hair, management no 
longer has an answer, because they've been educated by students 
about why it's simply unnecessary, so they're told "It's just the 
way it is", which is a lazy excuse for an answer.

Imagine spending the first 16 years of your life unable to express 
your identity at all, not being able to choose what clothes to 
wear, not being able to choose what you want to learn, not being 
able to choose your own fucking future. The experience is 
genuinely soul-crushing, and it is setting up 
students for failure. Every day I would tell myself "You've only 
got ùë• years left", like I'm counting down the days till I can 
leave. Like an actual prison. It can really only be described as a 
prison the way students are taught.

Schools should be a place where kids can flourish and become who 
they want to be. Students should be treated like actual people 
rather than tools for the Tory Government. In the future I'm 
planning to write a post about what I think *the perfect school 
system* would be like, so I want to hear from all of you! Click 
below and leave me a note about your experiences with school, your 
thoughts about this, and what you wish schools were like. Looking 
forward to hearing from you!
